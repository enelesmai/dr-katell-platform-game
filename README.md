## Design Process

### 1. Day One
As I didn't have previous experience using Phaser, the design process started with the skimming of the features that this tool offers for doing games. I used the next resources to learn how to use the library and to get used to the main functionalities:

* [Getting started tutorial](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1)
* [Create a videogame template](https://phasertutorials.com/creating-a-phaser-3-template-part-1/)

As a result I created [this repository](https://github.com/enelesmai/phaser3-template) which already has the main Scenes required for a game and some examples on how to load sound effects and images. 

### 2. Day Two
The second day was most of the time about reading on how to make a good game, the best practices, and making a plan to define the topic of the game and how will be the interaction with the player.

Some of the resources I used for this process were:

* [The 3 Primary Principles of Game Design](https://www.gamedesigning.org/learn/game-design-principles/)
* [Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Game Mechanics](https://www.gamedesigning.org/learn/basic-game-mechanics/)
* [The Ultimate Guide to Level Design](https://www.gamedesigning.org/learn/level-design/)
* [How (And Why) to Write a Great Game Design Document](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/how-and-why-to-write-a-great-game-design-document--cms-23545)

At this time I was ready to start building the game with the items I defined for it.

### 3. Day Three to Five
I used this time to develop the game, starting with the template I did before and following the design I created for it.

I divided this process in five main phases:
* Collect all the assets neeeded for the game (images and sounds)
* Build the escenes
* Build the factories and modules needed
* Build the services
* Working on connect the elements of the game and the gameflow

## Getting Started
